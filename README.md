This project focuses on analyzing ER visit data to gain insights into healthcare system efficiency and patient experience. It examines average wait times to identify service bottlenecks, explores patient satisfaction factors, and tracks monthly visit trends to understand demand fluctuations. The analysis also includes a comparison of administrative vs. non-administrative appointments to assess their impact on wait times and satisfaction, an evaluation of referred vs. walk-in patients, and a study of visit patterns across diverse age groups and racial demographics to uncover healthcare needs and preferences.
